The App Problem has something to do with the webkit and maxcontent on a mediaquery of 768 px min 
@media (min-width: 768px)
.md\:w-max {
    width: -webkit-max-content;
    width: -moz-max-content;
    width: max-content;
}
@media (min-width: 640px)
.sm\:px-11 {
    padding-left: 2.75rem;
    padding-right: 2.75rem;
}

and something to do with w-full being crossed out or not good luck.

update: Previously Failed to look closer at the width and compare and it was the width property that was obvious look out the box next time.
